<h2>Viewing and Panning Controls</h2>

<p>When GBRVU is launched from the PCB Importer, one or more layers will be displayed. The user can pan and zoom as well as turn layers on and off or assign different layer colors.</p>

<br>

<h3>Panning and Zooming</h3>
<p>There are several different ways to pan and zoom.</p>
<ul>
<p>Pan - hold the middle mouse button (or wheel) down and drag the cursor. The display will lock to the cursor until you let go of the middle button.
</p>

<p>Pan - use the left-right-up-down arrow buttons on the keyboard. Each click of the key will move the center of the display approximately 1/4 of the width or height.</p>

<p>Zoom - select the magnifying glass cursor. Dragging it from upper left to lower right will zoom in. Dragging it from lower right to upper left will zoom out.</p>


<p>Zoom - use the middle mouse wheel. Roll Away zooms in. Roll inward zooms out.</p>

<p>Zoom - use keyboard Ctrl + to zoom in and Ctrl - to zoom out (same as Adobe Photoshop)</p>
</ul>

<a name="layer_control"><h3>Layer Control</h3></a>
<p>If you have selected more than one layer to preview, or if you are doing a window extraction and need to turn off layers so that you can isolate a piece of circuitry you will want to use the layer dialog to control which layers are displayed.</p>

<p>Access this dialog using the File | Layer ... pulldown menu item.</p>


<img src="./file_layer_pulldown.gif" width=533 height=283 vspace=10 hspace=146 alt="layer dialog pulldown"><br>

<p>You should see a layer dialog that looks like this:</p>


<img src="./layer_dialog1.gif" width=405 height=497 vspace=10 hspace=210 alt="layer dialog"><br>

<p><b>Actions</b></p>
<ul>
<p><b>Layer On/Off </b>- Check or uncheck next to the layer to turn display on/off. You must click either Apply or Close for the display to update.</p>

<p><b>Paint/Scratch/Negative</b> - Do not change the Paint/Scratch/Negative Button as this information is derived from the ODB++ data.</p>

<p><b>Color</b> - click on the rectangle to get a color dialog. Select from one of the available colors.</p>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Re-Odering the Display Painting</b></p>
<p>It may be useful occasionally to re-order the display. GBRVU paints the display in the order shown. It is possible that data you would like to see is covered by a layer that is painted more recently.
</p>
<p>If turning off the covering layer is not acceptable, you could click on Reorder ... and use that dialog to move a layer up or down in the display order.</p>

<p>To re-order, first select a layer and then use the Move Up or Move Down button to move the layer's position in the drawing queue.</p>
<br><br>
<p>In the example below we have the top.gbr layer drawn first and the drill.gbr layer drawn afterwards. (We turned off comp_+_top.gbr and bottom.gbr layers.)</p>

<img src="./layer_order1.gif" width=376 height=310 vspace=10 hspace=224 alt="layer order top before drill"><br>

<p>The result is that one can see the drill holes over the top metal.</p>


<img src="./layer_order2.gif" width=539 height=653 vspace=10 hspace=142 alt="layer order top before drill"><br>

<br>

<p>However if we were to change the layer order so that the drill layer was drawn before the top layer, then the drill layer would be obscured by the top metal.</p>


<img src="./layer_order3.gif" width=376 height=310 vspace=10 hspace=224 alt="layer order drill before top"><br>

<br>

<p>Below: Drill display has been "covered" by the metal.</p>
