<p><font size=+1><b>Back Drilling to Reduce Via Parasitics</b></font></p>


<p>Backdrilling is a manufacturing technique used on high speed multi-layered boards to reduce the amount of parasitics generated by plated through holes. We encounter it mostly on designs where the bit rates are 10GB and above and where there are 12 or more layers.</p>

<p>Backdrilling is used because it is expensive to manufacture boards with buried and blind vias. Additional drilling and lamination steps are required when you have buried and blind vias.</p>

<p>But using through hole vias when one is not moving a signal from the very top to the very bottom of the board generates a new problem - the unused "stub" section can act as a tiny antenna and couple to other traces. While this effect is not a problem at low frequencies, the higher the frequency, the more significant the stub becomes.</p>

In this crossection, our objective is to move a signal from M1 to M3 using a via. You can see metalization for a pad on layers M1, M3 and on the bottom (M8)</p>

<h3>Simulating Back Drilled Boards</h3>
<p>If you are using an advanced EM simulator to predict impedance, coupling or delay and you are working at bit rates or frequencies of 10GB/10GHz and above then you will want to take the back drilling into consideration.</p>

<br>

<p><b>Problem - ODB++ Doesn't Know About Back Drilling</b></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the ODB++ database does not have a way to mark drill data as back drilling. Such drill files will appear in the ODB++ database but our program has no automatic way to determine that they are in fact back drills.</p>

<p>We have enabled a user option in the program (Expect Back Drill) that when turned "on" will check the drill files to see if they share common coordinates that pass through common layers. Under this condition it can detect back drills and will modify the output vias accordingly.</p>
