==========================================================

In ADS2006A, the performance of the Physical Connectivity
Engine has been improved, dramatically reducing the delay
caused by the real-time extraction of the layout connectivity
information.

This capability lets you create electrical interconnects by
overlapping polygonal-shaped layout artwork. ADS detects these
physical interconnects in real time. However, this capability
does require additional processing and may slow down editing
of extremely large layouts.

To enable or disable the Physical Connectivity Engine, go to
the "Tools > Preference" menu in the main ADS window.
