- These are arbitary example ADS simulator model files for some
  ficticious (and probably erroneous) process technology. They are
  intended for demonstration only.

- These model files are used by the active devices in our examples.

- The following UNIX shell command gives model description formats for
  the various devices known to the ADS simulator.

    adssim -help <device>
