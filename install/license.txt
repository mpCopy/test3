If your payment is determined by usage of the Software, you also will provide Keysight with remote and on-site access to your network and on-site access to your records, as is reasonably necessary to conduct a proper audit. If, after an audit, it is determined that you have underpaid any amounts due, Keysight will invoice you for and you agree to pay the amount of the underpayment, plus interest, from the date payment was due.

15.   U.S. Government Rights. The Software is “commercial computer software,” as defined by Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101. Pursuant to FAR 12.212 and 27.405-3 and Department of Defense FAR Supplement (“DFARS”) 227.7202, the U.S. government acquires commercial computer software under the same terms by which the software is customarily provided to the public. Accordingly, Keysight provides the Software to U.S. government customers under its standard commercial license, which is embodied in this EULA. The license set forth in this EULA represents the exclusive authority by which the U.S. government may use, modify, distribute, or disclose the Software. This EULA and the license set forth herein, does not require or permit, among other things, that Keysight: (1) furnish technical information related to commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation that is not customarily provided to the public; or (2) relinquish to, or otherwise provide, the U.S. government rights in excess of these rights customarily provided to the public to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation. If you are a U.S. government customer, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the Software and this EULA and agree that the license provided for herein is consistent with federal law and otherwise satisfies U.S. government needs. If you are a U.S. government customer, you agree that this EULA reflects the entirety of the terms of Keysight’s customary commercial license applicable to U.S. government customers. No additional government requirements beyond those set forth in this EULA shall apply, except to the extent that those terms, rights, or licenses are explicitly required from all providers of commercial computer software pursuant to the FAR and the DFARS and are set forth specifically in writing elsewhere in this EULA. Keysight shall be under no obligation to update, revise, or otherwise modify the Software.
16.   WARRANTY. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE MANDATORY LAW, AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT KEYSIGHT HAS PROVIDED A SPECIFIC WRITTEN WARRANTY APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. KEYSIGHT, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND SUPPLIERS, SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. SHOULD THE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AND COST RESULTING FROM OR RELATING TO THE DEFECT.
17.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE MANDATORY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL KEYSIGHT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES (INCLUDING DOWNTIME COSTS, LOSS OF DATA, RESTORATION COSTS, OR LOST PROFITS) REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU AT NO CHARGE, KEYSIGHT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT DAMAGES.
18.   Applicable Law; Jurisdiction and Venue. Disputes arising in connection with this EULA will be governed by, construed, and interpreted according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention for Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to this EULA. You consent to personal jurisdiction and venue for all claims arising out of or related in any way to this EULA in a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco county in the Northern District of California, United States. You agree that the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all claims arising out of or related in any way to this EULA and your use of the Software. If you are a U.S. government customer, disputes arising in connection with this EULA will be governed by, construed, and interpreted according to U.S. federal common law.
19.   Data Privacy. Information about Keysight’s privacy practices is available in Keysight’s Customer Privacy Statement, available at www.keysight.com/go/privacy.
20.   Unenforceability. To the extent that any provision of this EULA is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.
21.   Entire Agreement. Certain program, data, and license files in the Software may be subject to supplemental license terms found in the documentation associated with the Software or directly in the files to which the supplemental terms apply.

This EULA may not be changed except by an amendment signed by you and Keysight’s authorized representative.
