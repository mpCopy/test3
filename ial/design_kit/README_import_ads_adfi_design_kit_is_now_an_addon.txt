Pre-ADS 2012 ADFI versions are not compatible with this ADS version. Some AEL functions no longer exist. You need to upgrade.

The ADFI Import Tools come as an AEL add-on now. Previously, the design kit mechanism was used.
* Enable this add-on from the Tools > App Manager menu in the ADS Main Window.
* Remove the old ADFI design kit from the libraries used by the workspace (open Design Kit > Manage Libraries...).
* Restart ADS.
